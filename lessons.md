# Lessons

There's a bunch of good content in the kennedy courses, I think it could be arranged as a list of content to cover.

14 weeks, 2 classes / week. 28 lessons max.  Call it 24. Current list is ~44 so that would be 2 big lessons per class.


2.2 Alignment. when in doubt, line it up. | Things look better aligned. It's just human nature. Corollary: Mis-align for a good reason.
Sizing. Hierarchy. visual difference communicate other kinds of differences. | Use it in this manner.
- Systems over Instances | Stop designing for one specific use and think about a system with variations. How does that view look when there are three items? three hundred items? zero items? How can that list view be applied to all cases of listed items?
