              <h1>Welcome</h1>
              <p>This studio course is an introduction to designing digital products for the screen. We'll follow a human-centered iterative design process that includes research, concepting, prototyping, testing, visualization, and refinement.</p>
              <p>Over the course of the semester we'll tackle two projects with step-by-step guided processes, and then we will each create a single independent project. Along the way you'll post your work to a single website, and by the end of the semester you'll have a good document showing everything you accomplished.</p>
              <p>This syllabus will be updated with more information throughout the semester. I'll let you know in class about updates.</p>
            </div><!--#welcome-->


            <div id="course" class="section">

              <h2>Course Components</h2>

              <h3>Projects</h3>

              <p>Over the semester, we'll tackle three larger projects, which will be made of smaller, discrete tasks. As the semester progresses, you'll have more flexibilty to use the tools appropriate to your project.</p>

              <h4><a href="inventory.html">Fearless Inventory</a></h4>
              <p>In this intro project, you will design a tool for warehouse or store inventory. Your solution will assist a user in reconciling a <em>putative</em> inventory quantity with <em>actual</em> in-person inventory in a physical location. You will design the tool for an imaginary brand of your choice. We'll flesh out the details together.</p>
              <p>We will: research the problem and propose solutions. Create workflows and wireframes. Do some lightweight user testing. Develop mockup proposals and prototypes. Test and refine those prototypes.</p>

              <h4><a href="desk.html">Desk Reservations</a></h4>
              <p>In this project, we will design a tool for on-demand desk assignments at a large company. Your solution will need to accomodate desk reservations, travel, in-person searches, and other user requests. The solution will have two user levels with different functional requirements.  Your design will need to complement a large existing brand.</p>
              <p>We will follow the same general process as the Inventory project, but this time you'll know what you're doing.</p>

              <h4><a href="niche.html">Niche, Please</a></h4>
              <p>You will propose and define a software tool that targets a niche audience or subject matter, which you will pitch to the class. If you can't settle on a niche for yourself, I'll have a few projects you can choose from.</p>
              <p>We will follow the same general process as above, but with more freedom and flexibility. We will regularly show our work.</p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>Readings</h3>
              <p>About once per week you will have an assigned 'text'.  Some of these texts are actual readings, others will be videos and other interactive activities. They will be online and easily accessible. For each text, you'll write a short response, and post it to your site. <a href="#texts">Consult the reading list below.</a></p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>Project Submission</h3>
              <p>You're going to turn everything in by posting it on your own website, and then posting a URL to your submission to the slack team. </p>
              <p>You'll be maintaining your site throughout the semester, and making choices about information architecture, design, and layout. It will be a daily tool that you use to submit work, but also a final document showing your work for the semester.</p>
              <p>This means: you will need to get some basic HTML under your belt in order to participate. We'll walk you through the basics - you can learn what you need in 15 minutes. </p>
              <p>Don't be afraid.</p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>Slack</h3>
              <p>We'll be using Slack as a communication platform. Question for me? Reach out on slack. Questions for everybody? Reach out on Slack.</p>
              <p>We're doing this in part for convenience, and in part because it more closely models what real work is going to be like; much of the time you will need to communicate remotely and asynchronously with your clients and colleagues, and you should get good at it now.  When you submit your work on Slack, you should introduce it and draw our attention to anything of note.</p>
              <p>We'll have separate channels for a few discussion areas, but you should feel free to create / join / leave channels as you see fit.</p>
              <p><em>nota bene:</em> I probably won't monitor Slack from 9-5.</p>

              <hr/>

              <h3>Teach an Old Person Something</h3>
              <p>Once per class meeting, I'll randomly select one person to tell me something they think a 36-year-old person doesn't know. You'll need to have this prepared in advance, so figure out your thing now.</p>
              <p>Take a couple of minutes and explain something to me that you think I - a 36-year-old white dude, married, kids, full-time job, mortgage, etc - doesn't know or understand. A niche subculture on instagram? Some weird piece of slang? Some kind of technology? Music? Art? You don't need to prepare anything besides your idea, just have something ready when you walk in the door. You'll need to do this about twice per semester. </p>
              <p>Consider this an exercise in designing for an audience. You'll get better at this as we go.</p>

            </div>



            <div id="texts" class="section">
              <h2>Texts</h2>
              <p>I'm very convinced that you need to be good writers and readers if you're going be good designers - because that's how design happens in the real world. You'll always need to explain why your solution works, and show us how.</p>

              <p>I'll assign some things to read or watch or listen to throughout the semester. They'll all be online.  For each 'text', you'll need to write a short response, and post it on your website. Your response can be short or long, but needs to include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>NEW: something in the text that was new to you.</li>
                <li>RIGHT: something in the text that you agreed with.</li>
                <li>WRONG: something in the text that you disagreed with.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This shouldn't take you more than say, 30 minutes.</p>
