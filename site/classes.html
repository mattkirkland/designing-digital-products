    <h1>The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, "Gentleman"</h1>
    <h2 id="author">by Laurence Sterne</h2>
    <p><em>Tristram Shandy</em> is one of the funniest, most ridiculous books ever written. It's an early example of experimental and postmodern literature, using digressions, tangents, footnotes, false starts, and nested shaggy-dog stories. It was published in nine volumes, the first two appearing in 1759, and seven others following over the next seven years. </p>

      <p>I wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as
      they were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they
      were about when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much
      depended upon what they were then doing;&mdash;that not only the
      production of a rational Being was concerned in it, but that
      possibly the happy formation and temperature of his body, perhaps
      his genius and the very cast of his mind;&mdash;and, for aught they
      knew to the contrary, even the fortunes of his whole house might
      take their turn from the humours and dispositions which were then
      uppermost;&mdash;Had they duly weighed and considered all this, and
      proceeded accordingly,&mdash;I am verily persuaded I should have
      made a quite different figure in the world, from that in which the
      reader is likely to see me.&mdash;Believe me, good folks, this is
      not so inconsiderable a thing as many of you may think
      it;&mdash;you have all, I dare say, heard of the animal spirits, as
      how they are transfused from father to son, &amp;c.
      &amp;c.&mdash;and a great deal to that purpose:&mdash;Well, you may
      take my word, that nine parts in ten of a man's sense or his
      nonsense, his successes and miscarriages in this world depend upon
      their motions and activity, and the different tracks and trains you
      put them into, so that when they are once set a-going, whether
      right or wrong, 'tis not a half-penny matter,&mdash;away they go
      cluttering like hey-go mad; and by treading the same steps over and
      over again, they presently make a road of it, as plain and as
      smooth as a garden-walk, which, when they are once used to, the
      Devil himself sometimes shall not be able to drive them off it.</p>
      <p>Pray my Dear, quoth my mother, have you not forgot to wind up
      the clock?&mdash;Good G..! cried my father, making an exclamation,
      but taking care to moderate his voice at the same time,&mdash;Did
      ever woman, since the creation of the world, interrupt a man with
      such a silly question? Pray, what was your father
      saying?&mdash;Nothing.</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1.II.</h2>
      <p>&mdash;Then, positively, there is nothing in the question that I
      can see, either good or bad.&mdash;Then, let me tell you, Sir, it
      was a very unseasonable question at least,&mdash;because it
      scattered and dispersed the animal spirits, whose business it was
      to have escorted and gone hand in hand with the Homunculus, and
      conducted him safe to the place destined for his reception.</p>
      <p>The Homunculus, Sir, in however low and ludicrous a light he may
      appear, in this age of levity, to the eye of folly or
      prejudice;&mdash;to the eye of reason in scientific research, he
      stands confess'd&mdash;a Being guarded and circumscribed with
      rights.&mdash;The minutest philosophers, who by the bye, have the
      most enlarged understandings, (their souls being inversely as their
      enquiries) shew us incontestably, that the Homunculus is created by
      the same hand,&mdash;engender'd in the same course of
      nature,&mdash;endow'd with the same loco-motive powers and
      faculties with us:&mdash;That he consists as we do, of skin, hair,
      fat, flesh, veins, arteries, ligaments, nerves, cartilages, bones,
      marrow, brains, glands, genitals, humours, and
      articulations;&mdash;is a Being of as much activity,&mdash;and in
      all senses of the word, as much and as truly our fellow-creature as
      my Lord Chancellor of England.&mdash;He may be benefitted,&mdash;he
      may be injured,&mdash;he may obtain redress; in a word, he has all
      the claims and rights of humanity, which Tully, Puffendorf, or the
      best ethick writers allow to arise out of that state and
      relation.</p>
      <p>Now, dear Sir, what if any accident had befallen him in his way
      alone!&mdash;or that through terror of it, natural to so young a
      traveller, my little Gentleman had got to his journey's end
      miserably spent;&mdash;his muscular strength and virility worn down
      to a thread;&mdash;his own animal spirits ruffled beyond
      description,&mdash;and that in this sad disorder'd state of nerves,
      he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a series of melancholy
      dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months together.&mdash;I
      tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for a thousand
      weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the physician
      or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly to
      rights.</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1.III.</h2>
      <p>To my uncle Mr. Toby Shandy do I stand indebted for the
      preceding anecdote, to whom my father, who was an excellent natural
      philosopher, and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest
      matters, had oft, and heavily complained of the injury; but once
      more particularly, as my uncle Toby well remember'd, upon his
      observing a most unaccountable obliquity, (as he call'd it) in my
      manner of setting up my top, and justifying the principles upon
      which I had done it,&mdash;the old gentleman shook his head, and in
      a tone more expressive by half of sorrow than reproach,&mdash;he
      said his heart all along foreboded, and he saw it verified in this,
      and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me, That I
      should neither think nor act like any other man's child:&mdash;But
      alas! continued he, shaking his head a second time, and wiping away
      a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, My Tristram's
      misfortunes began nine months before ever he came into the
      world.</p>
      <p>&mdash;My mother, who was sitting by, look'd up, but she knew no
      more than her backside what my father meant,&mdash;but my uncle,
      Mr. Toby Shandy, who had been often informed of the
      affair,&mdash;understood him very well.</p>
      <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1.IV.</h2>
      <p>I know there are readers in the world, as well as many other
      good people in it, who are no readers at all,&mdash;who find
      themselves ill at ease, unless they are let into the whole secret
      from first to last, of every thing which concerns you.</p>
      <p>It is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a
      backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that I
      have been so very particular already. As my life and opinions are
      likely to make some noise in the world, and, if I conjecture right,
      will take in all ranks, professions, and denominations of men
      whatever,&mdash;be no less read than the Pilgrim's Progress
      itself&mdash;and in the end, prove the very thing which Montaigne
      dreaded his Essays should turn out, that is, a book for a
      parlour-window;&mdash;I find it necessary to consult every one a
      little in his turn; and therefore must beg pardon for going on a
      little farther in the same way: For which cause, right glad I am,
      that I have begun the history of myself in the way I have done; and
      that I am able to go on, tracing every thing in it, as Horace says,
      ab Ovo.</p>
      <p>Horace, I know, does not recommend this fashion altogether: But
      that gentleman is speaking only of an epic poem or a
      tragedy;&mdash;(I forget which,) besides, if it was not so, I
      should beg Mr. Horace's pardon;&mdash;for in writing what I have
      set about, I shall confine myself neither to his rules, nor to any
      man's rules that ever lived.</p>
      <p>To such however as do not choose to go so far back into these
      things, I can give no better advice than that they skip over the
      remaining part of this chapter; for I declare before-hand, 'tis
      wrote only for the curious and inquisitive.</p>
      <p>&mdash;Shut the door.&mdash;</p>
      <p>I was begot in the night betwixt the first Sunday and the first
      Monday in the month of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand
      seven hundred and eighteen. I am positive I was.&mdash;But how I
      came to be so very particular in my account of a thing which
      happened before I was born, is owing to another small anecdote
      known only in our own family, but now made publick for the better
      clearing up this point.</p>
      <p>My father, you must know, who was originally a Turkey merchant,
      but had left off business for some years, in order to retire to,
      and die upon, his paternal estate in the county of &mdash;&mdash;,
      was, I believe, one of the most regular men in every thing he did,
      whether 'twas matter of business, or matter of amusement, that ever
      lived. As a small specimen of this extreme exactness of his, to
      which he was in truth a slave, he had made it a rule for many years
      of his life,&mdash;on the first Sunday-night of every month
      throughout the whole year,&mdash;as certain as ever the
      Sunday-night came,&mdash;to wind up a large house-clock, which we
      had standing on the back-stairs head, with his own hands:&mdash;And
      being somewhere between fifty and sixty years of age at the time I
      have been speaking of,&mdash;he had likewise gradually brought some
      other little family concernments to the same period, in order, as
      he would often say to my uncle Toby, to get them all out of the way
      at one time, and be no more plagued and pestered with them the rest
      of the month.</p>
      <p>It was attended but with one misfortune, which, in a great
      measure, fell upon myself, and the effects of which I fear I shall
      carry with me to my grave; namely, that from an unhappy association
      of ideas, which have no connection in nature, it so fell out at
      length, that my poor mother could never hear the said clock wound
      up,&mdash;but the thoughts of some other things unavoidably popped
      into her head&mdash;&amp; vice versa:&mdash;Which strange
      combination of ideas, the sagacious Locke, who certainly understood
      the nature of these things better than most men, affirms to have
      produced more wry actions than all other sources of prejudice
      whatsoever.</p>
      <p>But this by the bye.</p>
      <p>Now it appears by a memorandum in my father's pocket-book, which
      now lies upon the table, 'That on Lady-day, which was on the 25th
      of the same month in which I date my geniture,&mdash;my father set
      upon his journey to London, with my eldest brother Bobby, to fix
      him at Westminster school;' and, as it appears from the same
      authority, 'That he did not get down to his wife and family till
      the second week in May following,'&mdash;it brings the thing almost
      to a certainty. However, what follows in the beginning of the next
      chapter, puts it beyond all possibility of a doubt.</p>
      <p>&mdash;But pray, Sir, What was your father doing all December,
      January, and February?&mdash;Why, Madam,&mdash;he was all that time
      afflicted with a Sciatica.</p>
