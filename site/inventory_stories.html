  <h1>Fearless Inventory User Stories </h1>
  <p>User stories are one-sentence descriptions of actions a user can perform in a system; they describe WHO does something, WHAT they do, and WHY they do it. They always take this form:  <br/>
  <em>As a (user/persona/customer), I want to (do something) so that I will (receive a benefit).</em> <br/>
  Our user types we've discussed so far are the Warehouse Employees and the Operations Manager.</p>

  <h2>For Managers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As a manager, I want to log into the system, so that I can access our secret company info.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want to reset my password so I don't have to remember it forever.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want to add access or remove access for new or departing employees, so only people who currently work here can update inventory.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want to get a notification if we are getting low on a product, so I can order more.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want to know exactly what number of products I have, so that I don't  run out of items unexpectedly.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want a system/app that can be learned quickly, so that it doesn't take me long to show the employees how to use it. </li>

    <li>As a manager, I want to add new SKUs, so that when we grow I don't have to change everything.</li>

    <li>As a manager, I want a history of who changed inventory, so that I can hold employees accountable.</li>


    <li>As a manager I want to be able to get a daily report of the inventory, so that if any complications arise I will be aware at that time.</li>
    </ul>

    <li>As an employee, I want to reset my password, so I don't have to remember it forever.</li>

    <li>As an employee, I want to see the supposed count of products, so I know how many are supposed to be there.</li>

    <li>As an employee, I want to be able to enter the actual count of products, so we have an accurate picture of our inventory.</li>

    <li>As an employee, I want to be able to track damaged items, so that the inventory numbers can stay correct.</li>
