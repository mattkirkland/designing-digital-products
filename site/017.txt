- ASTOUNDING FACTS about your niche
- Niche, Please kickoff
- Today: defining your niche, ideas, preparing for your Niche PITCH











Make a presentation (Keynote, PPT, or PDF) for Wednesday.  Direct Message it to me over slack (NOT THE SUMBIT CHANNEL) if you want to keep your presentation a secret until you give it to the class.

In your Niche Pitch:
  - define your niche.
    - What is the subject area?
    - Who is interested in this niche?
    - Where are the edges: ie, who is NOT included in this?
  The more tightly you can define your niche, the more successful your project will be, I promise.

  - Propose THREE project ideas to the class. Convince us!  What will the software do? How does it serve the niche? How is it going to be better than what already serves the niche?
