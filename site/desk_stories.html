  <h1>Desk User Stories </h1>
  <p>User stories are one-sentence descriptions of actions a user can perform in a system; they describe WHO does something, WHAT they do, and WHY they do it. They always take this form:  <br/>
  <em>As a (user/persona/customer), I want to (do something) so that I will (receive a benefit).</em> </p>
</p>
  <hr/>
  <h2>As an employee...</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>I want to log in and out of the system, so that I can do identify myself.</li>
    <li>I want to reserve a desk for tomorrow, so I've got somewhere to sit.</li>
    <li>I want to reserve a desk for every day next week, so I've got somewhere to sit.</li>
    <li>I want to find where my friend is planning on sitting tomorrow, so I can book a desk nearby.</li>
    <li>I want to change a reservation so I can keep my plans flexible.</li>
    <li>I want to make most of my bookings in the same office, because most of the time I work in Oakland.</li>
    <li>I want to book a desk in an office I've never visited, so I know where to sit when I get to our Singapore office.</li>
    <li>I want to book my favorite desk so I have as many familiar comforts as possible</li>
    <li>I want to see a list of all the possible places to work so I can plan my next remote-workcation</li>
    <li>When I arrive at the office I want to easily check into my desk so I don't waste time</li>
    <li>I want to see which desks are available for reservation right now and in the future, for all locations in the company</li>
    <li>I want to find out where a colleague is sitting right now, so I can go speak with them.</li>

  </ol>
