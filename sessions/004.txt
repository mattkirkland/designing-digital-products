Based on the user feedback you got this week, make some improvements! Try to make a full set of sketches that cover the user stories we've laid out. Remember, these can still be loose - and we don't need to have every possible interaction covered. Just get enough concepts to cover the <a href="inventory_stories.html">user stories!
