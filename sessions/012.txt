Then for TUES: concept sketches & paper prototype

On thursday we'll do user stories and concept sketches.

You'll be designing for 2 types of users: staff and guests.
- User Stories to define functions:
    WHO the user is, WHAT she needs to do, and WHY she needs it.
    As ____, I want to ______ so that _________.
    (ref https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)
    remember not user scenarios, user stories

USER STORIES:
  As a guest, I want to ___ so that ____.
  As an employee, I want to ___ so that ____.

CONCEPT sketches of pick-a-seat function


- for Weds: concept sketches - demonstrate how the user actually books their desk. pencil & paper. scan + add to your site. include layouts for mobile and desktop sizes. Think about how they can be the same or share content!
