FIRST DRAFT at laying out your classwork site.


- wireframe / sketch it. I want at least 10 different layouts / proposals / sketches to show.
We're not going to legislate how many pages each approach has, but you should play with options that have
- everything in one big page (like a blog or tumblr),
- or, detail pages for each text response and project, and an index / cover / TOC to show

project files:
	- project title
	- project introduction
	- images
	- links
	- etc?

Work on this for X minutes, and then review. Pin up on the walls your most interesting? or sketchbook.
- design while we work on FTP connections for people one-on-one.
