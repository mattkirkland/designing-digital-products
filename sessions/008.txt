- attendance
- Teach an Old Person
- discussion: kennedy


- next reading
- re: wireframe testing  How'd it go?  What problems did you discover?

- lesson: color:

    COLOR - 3.1 HSB, RGBA, HEX. Screen color vs print color. Forget your pantone
    Lighting & Shadows. Light comes from the top. shadows communicate a z-axis. bigger shadow, bigger z depth

- You probably only need Gray + One Color (?)

- let's throw some style shit at this.
- you've got a skeleton, you basically know it works, let's see if we can improve it with style. Make it more clear. Make it more beautiful. Get your hierarchy in. Get your type right.
