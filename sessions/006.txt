  - broovi, emma, amberlyn, hadley, monica, samuel, victor
  - share tips, how did it go?
  - how much time?
  - go thru the tutorials.


- user testing introductory lecture.

- for user testing, we're going to have real people count a real thing. So get your wireframe prototype ready to handle that.  Let's say it needs to at least function
  - fill in some real text (like, real categories, real quantities, some real products)
  - then you're going to hand the user a ziplock of some object (rubber bands, pennies, whatever) and ask them to pretend that these are the object they are counting
  - then they need to count them and enter the count into the app.
- we'll do this after Thursday's class. Your assignment between now and then is to correct your prototype so it can accomodate that actual use case.
Also use this time to get used to the idea of talking to strangers!
- the weather this weekend will be gorgeous so I promise you that somewhere you will be able to find people outside, feeling cheerful

EXAMPLE SCRIPT:

HI - CAN YOU DO ME A REAL QUICK FAVOR?
- I'm doing a user test for class; this will take 4 minutes.
- This is a prototype of an app to count inventory in a coffeeshop warehouse
- I'm going to give you a task, and we'll watch you try it out.
- We're not testing YOU, there are no wrong answers
- This is a Prototype
- This isn't even my design, I'm just testing it. Don't spare my feeeeeeelings.
- I'm not going to help, I'll just watch to see what you do.
- Please think out loud, etc.
- ask for questions?
- OK, your role: you work in a warehouse of a coffee chain.  We need to count inventory.  This is a bunch of Earl Gray Tea.
- YOUR TASK: count these and enter the amount into the app.
- Remember, please try to think out loud.
(and afterwards)
THANK YOU AND MANY BLESSINGS UPON YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD
