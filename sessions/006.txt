HI - CAN YOU DO ME A REAL QUICK FAVOR?
- I'm doing a user test for class; this will take 4 minutes.
- This is a prototype of an app to count inventory in a coffeeshop warehouse
- I'm going to give you a task, and we'll watch you try it out.
- We're not testing YOU, there are no wrong answers
- This is a Prototype
- This isn't even my design, I'm just testing it. Don't spare my feeeeeeelings. 
- I'm not going to help, I'll just watch to see what you do.
- Please think out loud, etc.
- ask for questions?

- OK, your role: you work in a warehouse of a coffee chain.  We need to count inventory.  This is a bunch of Earl Gray Tea.
- YOUR TASK: count these and enter the amount into the app.
THANK YOU AND MANY BLESSINGS UPON YOU AND YOUR HOUSEHOLD
