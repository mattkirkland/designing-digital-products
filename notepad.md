This will be largely adapted from my previous rounds of ADS560, but with the benefit that we can expect every student to have already covered the basics of User-centered UX. So I think we can cut:
- Don Norman intro
- overview of specific methods

And instead spend more time on either studio work making stuff better, or cover some more nitty-gritty ideas
- design systems
- atomic stuff
- type on screens

ALSO I think we can cut the coding here, that's fun for me but I think was more or less a drag for many students, and few ended up with a site that wasn't embarrassing. But I love the idea that students should share their work in public one way or another. Maybe a webflow or equivalent? IDK.

OH, and maybe this could adapt a lot from:

Ugh, so good: 'Why color theory is useless' https://learnui.design/blog/color-in-ui-design-a-practical-framework.html

7 rules for designing UI:

And look at these nice icons: https://feathericons.com

- maybe instead of having them work from their own bad wireframes, I could give them a clean 'decent' wireframe that they could then apply a color story to.  To test out that stuff!

- Like, for each stage of the 'Fearless Inventory' project, make my own version and they have to start from there for each phase.

: user story set
: hand sketch
: wireframe
: mockup set
: prototype

I really should rework this so it's a replicable course that I could also run as a BNB Design internship program.

I have three weeks to get this class ready!  

Starting to layout out Inventory project so it's a step-by-step version, with a 'corrected' deliverable handed out to all so they can start each step from the same place.  The only flexibility they have is choosing an existing coffee brand to work with.

Maybe this should have some basic fundamentals of UI added throughout, like...
