This will be largely adapted from my previous rounds of ADS560, but with the benefit that we can expect every student to have already covered the basics of User-centered UX. So I think we can cut:
- Don Norman intro
- overview of specific methods

And instead spend more time on either studio work making stuff better, or cover some more nitty-gritty ideas
- design systems
- atomic stuff
- type on screens

ALSO I think we can cut the coding here, that's fun for me but I think was more or less a drag for many students, and few ended up with a site that wasn't embarrassing. But I love the idea that students should share their work in public one way or another. Maybe a webflow or equivalent? IDK.
