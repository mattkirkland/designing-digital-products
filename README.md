# designing-digital-products
This studio course is an introduction to designing digital products for the screen. We'll follow a human-centered, iterative design process that includes research, concepting, prototyping, testing, visualization, and refinement. Designing digital products requires new methods and new conceptual patterns that address the interrelated layers of user experience. Over the course of the semester you'll tackle two larger projects with a step-by-step guided process, and then you will each create a single independent project.
